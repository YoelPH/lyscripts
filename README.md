This package provides scripts to the `lynference` repository, where the inference pipelines live and run regarding the lympahtic progression project.

Since I work on different branches in `lynference` that correspond to different experiments, it is cumbersome to keep all scripts working and up to date over there. Hence, I created this package to centralize the developement of the scripts and focus on their implementation in the pipelines in separate repository.
